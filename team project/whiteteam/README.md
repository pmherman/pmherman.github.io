# White Team Assignment
The white team will be recreating the hangman exercise from scratch. With an exception, the game should be visually appealing,
and created with a tech theme (Perhaps use a robot to represent the hangman). 

## Rules
- The base game must work as originally designed.
- The user interface must be designed around a tech theme.

##Bonus
- Have portions of an image show up as wrong letters are guessed to represent the victim being hanged.
- Create a 2 human player version.

##Display
- Display letter placeholders, replacing placeholders as correct letters are guessed.
- Display incorrectly guessed letters.
